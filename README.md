# NEXA

NEXA is a universal, modular HR platform designed to help organizations structure, manage, and connect their people in a flexible way.

Built with scalability and adaptability in mind, NEXA does not assume fixed hierarchies or predefined organizational models. Instead, it provides a configurable core that can support companies of any size, structure, or industry.

## Core Principles

- **People-first, system-driven**  
- **Company-agnostic by design**  
- **Modular and extensible architecture**  
- **Built to scale from startups to enterprises**

## What NEXA Provides

- Organization and member management  
- Flexible groups and roles  
- Permission-based access control  
- A core foundation for HR-related modules and integrations  

NEXA is not just an HR application — it is an organizational layer that enables teams, systems, and processes to grow together.
